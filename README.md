# o2leon

A LWC application that pulls data from a google sheet of oxygen tank/concentrator providers in Leon, Guanajuato. Idea on how to use google sheets as a data source grabbed from [this article](https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-editable-webpage-with-google-spreadsheets-and-tabletop-js/).

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.
